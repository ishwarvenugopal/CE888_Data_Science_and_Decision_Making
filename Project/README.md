2) Medium Imbalance : Breast Cancer Dataset
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer

3) High Imbalance : Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver Prediction
https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction
The dataset was very large and hence wasn't uploaded here on Github

The following notebooks are present:

1) Dataset_1_preprocessing.ipynb: Gives the code for the pre-processing techniques applied for the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset

2) Final_datasets.ipynb: Gives the code for loading the final versions of all the three datasets
