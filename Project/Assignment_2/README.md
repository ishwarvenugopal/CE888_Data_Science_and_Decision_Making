## Learning from Imbalanced Datasets (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning)

The datasets used are:

* Low Imbalance: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/mrsantos/hcc-dataset#hcc-data-complete-balanced.csv

* Medium Imbalance : Breast Cancer Dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer

* High Imbalance : Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction (Due to the large size, the pre-processed dataset was not uploaded into this repository)

For the code used in pre-processing these datasets, go to https://github.com/ishwarvenugopal/CE888_Data_Science_and_Decision_Making/tree/master/Project/Assignment_1

The Python notebooks used in this work are:

* Assignment_2_Dataset_1_LowImbalance.ipynb : The implementation using the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset
* Assignment_2_Dataset_2_MediumImbalance.ipynb: The implementation using the Breast Cancer Dataset
* Assignment_2_Dataset_3_HighImbalance.ipynb: The implementation using the Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction
* Plots.ipynb: The code for generating the plots used in the report
